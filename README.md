# Hayedeh: Spotify Artist Dashboard

## Introduction
Welcome to the Hayedeh repository, where we bridge the gap between music and data analytics! With just a Spotify artist's ID, Spotify API credntioals (client id and client secret), you can generate a detailed Tableau dashboard that displays a variety of song properties. This tool helps fans, artists, and analysts alike to uncover the intricacies of musical compositions.

## Features

### Song Property Analysis
- **Danceability**: Measures how suitable a track is for dancing based on tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
- **Energy**: Represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity.
- **Loudness**: The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB).
- **Mode**: The modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived.
- **Speechiness**: Detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
- **Acousticness**: A measure of whether the track is acoustic.
- **Instrumentalness**: Predicts whether a track contains no vocals.
- **Liveness**: Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.

(You might want to expand on each feature, explaining how it impacts the listening experience or an artist's style.)
